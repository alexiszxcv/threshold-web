## Development Workflow

### Version Control Strategy
- **Repository**: GitHub (threshold-web)
- **Branching**: Main branch with direct commits for academic project
- **Tagging**: Semantic iteration tagging
  - `iteration-1`: Basic API implementation
  - `iteration-2`: Complete CRUD functionality
  - `iteration-3`: Final project completion

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual Testing**: Comprehensive CRUD testing via scripts
- **API Testing**: Automated test suite (`scripts/test-crud.js`)
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end user journey validation
- **Performance Testing**: Real-time monitoring and metrics

### Deployment Process
1. **Local Development**: Next.js dev server with hot reloading
2. **Production Build**: Standalone output for containerization
3. **Containerization**: Docker with Next.js buildpack
4. **Cloud Deployment**: Google Cloud Run with automatic scaling
5. **Environment Configuration**: Secure environment variable management

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Optimizations
- Next.js App Router for optimal routing
- Component lazy loading where appropriate
- Efficient state management with React hooks
- Tailwind CSS for optimized styling

### Backend Optimizations
